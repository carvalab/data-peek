# Future Plan

## Quick Wins
- [x] Query history - browse and re-run previous queries
- [x] Export results to CSV/JSON
- [x] Table search - quickly find tables in large schemas
- [x] Dark/light theme toggle (already in settings)
- [x] Connection picker (Cmd+P) and quick switching (Cmd+Shift+1-9)

## Medium Effort
- [ ] Saved queries/snippets - bookmark frequently used queries
- [ ] Column statistics - show min/max/null counts/distinct values
- [x] Connection folders/groups - organize many connections
- [ ] Multi-statement query execution (run multiple queries separated by `;`)

## Bigger Features
- [x] ERD visualization - see table relationships visually
- [x] Query execution plan viewer - analyze query performance (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- [ ] Data visualization - charts from query results
- [x] SQL autocomplete improvements (table/column suggestions) - already implemented
